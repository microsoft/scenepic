Point release adding additional wheels to support Apple Silicon and some
minor UI changes.

Improvements:
- The dropdown menu visibility can be directly controlled via `UIParameters`
- A `standalone` parameter has been added to `save_as_script` to enable the
  creation of standalone scripts.
- The `status_bar_visibility` of a `Scene` can now be set (i.e. it is not
  possible to hide the status bar if desired.)

Bug Fixes:
- While transparent backgrounds were supported by the library, it was
  not exposed via the client APIs. This has been fixed via a 4D color parameter
  for `Shading`.
