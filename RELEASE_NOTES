Point release adding new camera mode as well as some improvements.

Improvements:
- There is now a new camera control mode, "First Person", accessible by pressing
  <kbd>Tab</kbd>, which enables mouse-look and `wasdqe` movement controls
  (closes #22). The old mode, now called "Focus", is still available as the default.
- Font scale is now configurable on `VideoWriter`
- There is now a "reset camera" button on the control bar so that users without
  a keyboard can reset camera position
